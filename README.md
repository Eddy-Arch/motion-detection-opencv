# motion-detection-opencv
motion detection using opencv python, takes input from live camera feed.
## description
basically this script alerts you wnever the luve camera feed has changed, the code is stolen from another repo i cannot find.
so all credit goes to you.
### features
- define how intense change has to be before counting it as actual motion
- live feed
- beeps when motion is detected (only in bash terminal emulators that suport it, i.e kitty)
- detectes motion, duh.
